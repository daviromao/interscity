# API Docs

This folder contains the [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) documentation of the InterSCity's
REST APIs. This documentation considerers that you are running the InterSCity
with Kong. However, the documentation also divide the endpoints by microservice
and therefore also documents the individual APIs of each microservice.

Those who need to edit the documentation file  must use the Swagger Online
Editor, import one of the files (swagger.yml or swagger.json), and, after
finish editing, download the new docs in both extensions.

To visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources, we use the
[Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/). It automatically generates a 
Web page from the Swagger specification, with the visual documentation.
